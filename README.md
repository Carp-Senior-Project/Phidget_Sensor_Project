# Phidget Sensors Project

## Purpose
This project exists as a standalone project that supports the main Green Thumb website.
It is responsible for taking measurements from Phidgets. Once an initial measurement has been taken,
small deviations in the measurement will be sent to our database to be displayed on the front end.
